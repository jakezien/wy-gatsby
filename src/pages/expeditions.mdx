In partnership with Q’ero families, Willka Yachay offers expeditions to individuals and groups who appreciate the Q’eros, support their sustainable development, seek a strong intercultural connection with them, and wish to learn from their teachings.

Few have the opportunity to visit Q’eros. Those who are invited to meet them and travel to their out-of-this world beautiful home are changed forever. Willka Yachay would love to collaborate with you in meeting the goals of contributing to and learning from the Q’eros.

Our team will make expedition arrangements, coordinate with the Q’eros community and accompany you on your visit to Q’eros. We also offer trip planning services in Cusco, the Sacred Valley and visits to sacred sites with wonderful, wise guides. All proceeds support Willka Yachay schools and programs in Q’eros.

## Support

We will arrange a sustainable community development project that you may support. Past visitors have painted a school, built clean stoves, and helped maintain greenhouses, among other activities.

## Participate

Our travelers may experience Inkan weaving and farming, and to participate in traditional spiritual ceremonies.

Our guides, translators, cooks, and horse wranglers are all from Q’eros and take pride in sharing their culture and community with visitors. This work is one of the main ways they make a living.

Note: All of our expeditions and retreats are being postponed until 2021 or 2022, until a time when our beloved travelers can be in Q’eros without fear of hugging, holding hands and caring for one another and our compadres there... until a time when it’s clear that everyone is safe.

Join our next expedition to Q’eros, or write us about planning a private journey in Peru
