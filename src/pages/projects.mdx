### Willka Yachay is helping Q’eros obtain the tools they need to sustain their culture and thrive in the modern world.

## Schools

Willka Yachay builds and sustains a culturally and ecologically based school system high in the Andes. We founded and built the first preschool, primary schools, high school and adult learning center in the Q’eros villages of Ch’allmachimpana and Qocha Moqo.

Our schools teach the children to read and write in both their native Quechua and in Spanish, and prepare them to interact with the modern world while fostering their soulful and intelligent culture. We provide an education that enables young Q’eros to direct their community’s future.

## Energy and Food Security

Willka Yachay supports energy and food security in Q’eros.
Over the past ten years, we have installed dozens of solar panel systems for family homes and schools in Q’eros.
In 2019 we began a partnership with a local Peruvian organization to build greenhouses for schools and family homes in Q’eros.

## Cultural Preservation

The Q’eros people are the wisdom keepers of the Andes. The Q’eros Nation has been designated by Peru’s Ministry of Culture as a “national living cultural patrimony” for the continuity of its ancient Andean traditions. Considered to be the último ayllu inka, or the last Inkan community of Peru, the Q’eros strive to preserve and promote their indigenous ethnic and cultural identity.

Their wisdom is expressed in their daily lives through their ancient customs of weaving, farming, music, plant medicine and spirituality. Moms, dads and elders teach all of these and more in our schools.

## Music Preservation

Student musicians are working to recover, preserve, and record traditional songs based on their own ethnographic research. They perform at community events throughout the region and outside of Peru.

In 2011 Willka Yachay and one its first teachers created the event Inka Taki. Q’eros children gather every year to remember, learn and sing ancestral songs. The event is now run by the Ministry of Culture and is continued every year.

## Traditional & Emergency Medical Care

Working with traditional Q’eros healers, or curanderos, primary and secondary students are learning about native medicinal plants and their uses.

Willka Yachay provides emergency health care support, including transportation from Q’eros to city doctors and dentists, rehabilitation care and patient/family social services.

Q’eros has a high child mortality rate. Willka Yachay provides nutritious food, warm blankets, wool clothing, emergency care and medications for mothers and babies.

## Weaving Cooperative

Willka Yachay and Q’eros mothers and fathers have formed a cooperative to sell their traditional weavings at a just price locally and abroad. The celebration of this ancient and extraordinarily beautiful tradition at the heart of Q’eros culture is promoting its perpetuation by younger generations while enhancing community and family economic security.
